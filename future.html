        <h1>Future of AI</h1>
        <p>The future might see a surge in drone usage. Not to get alarmed! I am talking about the drones used near the Eiffel Tower or Statue of Liberty instead of the ones in the military. A few e-commerce companies are planning to have the products and items delivered to their customers with the use of drone technology. Because drones are capable of flying, they are less likely to get stuck during road construction or a traffic jam. That way you’ll have instruments to routinely check the regions that you might not be able to go is a safer way to get things delivered. This network of autonomous drones flying around and taking care of things will strengthen the future vision of many of us. Its idiosyncrasies will be almost similar to the start of the mobile phone revolution in the 1990s.<br>
            The Turing test suggested that if any man is convinced that he is speaking to a human while communicating with a machine, the machine can be considered as intelligent.<br>
            When you live in a world where your computer is not just bound to a specific device but can be anywhere you want to put it, it means computers will have to react to humans much more intelligently than they do now. Right now, if you do something wrong today, your computer throws up an error, you close it, and that’s it. But imagine if, for example, you had a full-scale game that was in your apartment and something went wrong. Where does the dialog box go then? Should there be one at all? There are a lot of open questions around how humans will want to interact with their computers. For example, Four square did a really great job with having with having location-based notifications designed to give you the right information at the right time. There are many, many applications that should be making use of that kind of awareness today. And in the future, having these really intelligent ways of surfacing information are going to move from ‘nice-to-haves’ to essentials.
