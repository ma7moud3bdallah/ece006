        <h1>Pros and cons of AI</h1>
        <p>Everything in excess is dangerous and so is the case with Artificial Intelligence. It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, that makes it significant. With the simulation of human intelligence, processes by machines that are especially computer systems include learning the acquisition of information and rules for using it. The reasoning uses rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions and self-correction.<br>
            There is no doubt in saying that technology is an essential part of the development and growth of humans. A thin line or mistake leads to disruption or destruction.

        <p>All being said, the pros and cons of artificial intelligence being evaluated, it is up to the reader, user, and their perspective. AI and robotics will improve the way we think, the way we explore new horizons, whether space or the ocean. As the age-old saying goes, necessity is the mother of all innovations, so is the case with AI. Human beings know what they need and are getting increasingly better in defining their wants and quickly transforming this into reality.
